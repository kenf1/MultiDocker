## MultiDocker

Build multiple Docker images from monorepo

### Contents

The pre-built images include:

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|R-arm64|Run R natively for arm64 devices|
|R-x64|Run R via emulation for arm64 devices|

***Note***: `dl_vsix.sh` or `dl_vsix.py` is meant to be run once, manually. It is used to cut down on install time under x64 emulation.
